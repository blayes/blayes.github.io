Students
======

I have the pleasure of advising many bright undergraduate and graduate students. I am currently working with following students:

2. [Sreya Sarkar](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
2. [James "JC" Thomas](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
2. [Ian Hultman](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
1. [Zongyi Xu](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)

The following students have moved on to the next phase of their careers after working with me at Iowa. 

Ph.D. Alumni (and their first position)
------
1. [Chunlei Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunlei-wang-44966318b), Data Scientist at Google.

B.S. and M.S. Alumni (and their first position)
------

1. [Ziyu Gao](https://stat.osu.edu/), Ph.D. student, Ohio State University
1. [Yunyi Li](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/PhD/Areas-of-Study/IROM), Ph.D. student, UT Austin
1. [Yixiang Xu](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/yixiang-xu), Ph.D. student, UC Berkeley 
2. Yilin Ye, M.S. student, Vanderbilt University
3. Shiyang Chen, Analyst, ComScore

If you'd like to work with me, please email me about your research interests.  I am sure we can find a project that is interesting for us. 

Collaborators
======

I am actively collaborating with [Dipankar Bandopadhyay](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~dbandyop/), [Ray Bai](http://raybai.net/), [Rajarshi Guhaniyogi](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rajguhaniyogi/), and [Terrance Savitsky](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/contact.htm) on divide-and-conquer algorithms for inference and prediction in a variety of Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models. I am working with [Kshitij Khare](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~kdkhare/) on Asynchronous Data Augmentation.  [Cheng Li](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/stalic/) and I started working on distributed Bayesian inference as postdoctoral researchers. Our collaboration focuses primarily on high-dimensional Gaussian processes. 

I collaborate  extensively with scientists and clinicians. My methodological research on EHR data is motivated by the data collected by [Stephanie Gilbertson-White](http://www.nursing.uiowa.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/sgilbertsonwhite) in the College of Nursing. My other collaborator is [Rainbo Hultman](https://hultman.lab.uiowa.edu/), whose lab is located in the College of Medicine. We are focused on modeling field potential, gene expression, and imaging data.

If you have any projects that would benefit from my expertise, then please email me.
