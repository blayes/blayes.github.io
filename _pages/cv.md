Collaborators
======

I collaborate with [Dipankar Bandopadhyay](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~dbandyop/) and [Ray Bai](http://raybai.net/) on divide-and-conquer methods for inference and prediction in Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models. [Cheng Li](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/stalic/) and I began working on distributed Bayesian inference as postdoctoral researchers, and our current focus is on high-dimensional Gaussian processes.

I also work closely with scientists and clinicians. My methodological research is shaped by ongoing collaborations with the [Hultman Lab](https://hultman.lab.uiowa.edu/) in the College of Medicine. Together, the Hultman Lab and my group model local field potentials, gene expression, and imaging data.

With [Kshitij Khare](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~kdkhare/) and [Partha Sarkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/partha-sarkar-78a6b5a5/), I am developing theory and algorithms supported by [DMS-2506058](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2506058&HistoricalAwards=false). 

If you have a project that could benefit from my expertise, please email me.
