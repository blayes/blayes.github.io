Students
======

I have the pleasure of advising many bright undergraduate and graduate students. I am currently working with following students:

1. [Lyle Paukner](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
2. [Sreya Sarkar](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
2. [Ian Hultman](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)
1. [Zongyi Xu](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people)

Many students have moved on to the next phase of their careers after working with me at Iowa. 

Ph.D. Alumni (and their first position)
------
1. [Chunlei Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunlei-wang-44966318b), Data Scientist at Google.
2. [Alex Liebrecht](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people), Lecturer at the University of Iowa.

B.S. and M.S. Alumni (and their first position)
------
1. [Yutong Jin](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people).
1. [James "JC" Thomas](https://stat.uiowa.edu/people), Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health, University of Iowa.
1. [Ziyu Gao](https://stat.osu.edu/), Ph.D. student at the Ohio State University.
1. [Yunyi Li](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/PhD/Areas-of-Study/IROM), Ph.D. student at UT Austin.
1. [Yixiang Xu](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/yixiang-xu), Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.
2. Yilin Ye, M.S. student at Vanderbilt University.
3. Shiyang Chen, Analyst at ComScore.

If you'd like to work with me, please email me about your research interests.  I am sure we can find a project that is interesting for us. 

Collaborators
======

I am actively collaborating with [Dipankar Bandopadhyay](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~dbandyop/), [Ray Bai](http://raybai.net/), [Rajarshi Guhaniyogi](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rajguhaniyogi/), and [Terrance Savitsky](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/contact.htm) on divide-and-conquer algorithms for inference and prediction in a variety of Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models. I am working with [Kshitij Khare](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~kdkhare/) on Asynchronous Data Augmentation.  [Cheng Li](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/stalic/) and I started working on distributed Bayesian inference as postdoctoral researchers. Our collaboration now focuses primarily on high-dimensional Gaussian processes. 

I collaborate  extensively with scientists and clinicians. My methodological research on EHR data is motivated from the data collected by [Stephanie Gilbertson-White](http://www.nursing.uiowa.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/sgilbertsonwhite) in the College of Nursing. My other collaborator at Iowa is [Rainbo Hultman](https://hultman.lab.uiowa.edu/), whose lab is located in the College of Medicine. The Hultman lab and my research group focuses on modeling local field potential, gene expression, and imaging data.

If you have any projects that would benefit from my expertise, then please email me.
