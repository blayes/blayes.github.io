I am a tenured Associate Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) (*Go Hawkeyes!*). I joined Iowa in Fall 2015 after postdoctoral research at [SAMSI](https://www.samsi.info) and [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu), where I was mentored by [David Dunson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunson) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2013 from [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) under the guidance of [Rebecca Doerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Doerge). My academic path in statistics began at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/), where I completed a five-year integrated M.Sc. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing in 2007.

My research focuses on scalable Bayesian computation, dimension reduction, and array-variate mixed models. I develop divide-and-conquer methods to scale posterior inference. Recently, my work has emphasized applications of array-variate models and high-dimensional Gaussian processes to neuroscience, including multimodal data from local field potentials, gene expression, and imaging.

I collaborate extensively with scientists and clinicians and teach students across a range of backgrounds. At Iowa, I developed and regularly teach two courses in statistical learning (launched in Fall 2016 and Spring 2023).

## Funding
My research has been supported by the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundationâ€™s Division of Mathematical Sciences, and National Institue of Mental Health. Current support includes [NSF DMS-2506058](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2506058&HistoricalAwards=false) (Co-PI) and NIH R01 OD039332 (Co-Investigator with [Rainbo Hultman](https://hultman.lab.uiowa.edu/) and [Hanna Stevens](https://stevens.lab.uiowa.edu/) as MPIs).
